# Python-Pokemon-Like-Game
A battle mini-game that plays similar to a Pokemon game. It is a turn based game against a computer.

You take turns with the computer choosing actions to make on your turn. 
The actions have a range of values that they may use and a percentage that they will miss.
The game ends when 1 person gets to 0 health remaining
